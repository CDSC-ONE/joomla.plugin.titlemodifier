# joomla.plugin.titlemodifier
The Joomla Title Modifier Plugin automatically alters the titles of articles in Joomla. It works by counting the words in an article's title and wrapping the first half of the title in a &lt;span> tag. This allows for targeted styling or manipulation of the title's first half, enhancing visual design or readability.
